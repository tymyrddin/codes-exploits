# Shellcodes and exploits

After identifying a potential vulnerability, the next step is to determine its exploitability.  Different vulnerabilities may be easier or harder to exploit, especially using Python. 

Most of this code is written in Python, a few are Python bindings for existing C libraries (making those libraries easily usable from Python programs).
